Hi, I'm Jordan.
I'm a systems engineer, which means that in addition to writing my own code, I solve problems that involve making lots of other peoples' code all work together.
I build a lot of custom Linux distributions.
I helped build two different ones for a company that used to be called Cleversafe, but is now [IBM Cloud Object Storage](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/object-storage).
I worked on another distribution for GitHub, which lives inside of [GitHub Enterprise Server](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.5/admin/overview/about-github-enterprise-server).

I'm currently contracting and working on my own products as [Caketop](https://caketop.app).
I'm also [writing articles](portfolio) and investing tiny amounts of money in friends' companies.

I am most comfortable programming in Python or C; I can also be happy and productive in Ruby or Perl.
I am very well-versed in bash and POSIX shell scripting.
I have somewhat less experience with Go, but I am using it for more things lately and enjoying it.
I know just enough JavaScript and TypeScript to keep myself out of trouble.

I'm into Docker, OSTree, Podman, and systemd.
When I'm not running a distribution I built myself, I tend to prefer Debian, Ubuntu, or, for smaller devices, OpenWRT.
When I'm building a distribution that's that's not a Debian derivative, I use Yocto.

I am available for contract work.
I can help you build your backend, set up your CI, package and publish your software, or even build another custom Linux distribution for you.
I only work remotely.
You can find my email address on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/jordemort), or fill out the [contact form](https://caketop.app/#contact) on the Caketop website.
