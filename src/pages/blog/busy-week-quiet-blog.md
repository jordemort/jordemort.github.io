Dear beloved readers, I have not forgotten you.
I have been busy with a variety of other projects this week; among them, you may have noticed that this blog has grown a fancy "Search" feature.
It should be in the page header; please try it out.
I'm working on a long post that explains how it works, but it's going to be close to dinnertime by the time I'm done writing it.
I'm going to hold off on publishing it until Monday instead of dropping some heavy content at the exact moment that a lot of people will want to switch their brains and their screens off for a couple days.

In other news, [my latest article for LWN](/blog/lwn-lxc-lxd-a-different-container-story/) is currently on the front page of [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32953225).
I don't have a comment section here, so this is your chance to drop by that thread and heckle me.
