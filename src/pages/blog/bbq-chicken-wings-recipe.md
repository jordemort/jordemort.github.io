Hey, did you know I make really good BBQ chicken wings?
I use a recipe I invented myself, and every time I make it I'm terrified I'll forget how to do it; I've never written it down.
Today, that changes!

I'm writing this mostly because I want to print it out and add it to my cookbook, but since I don't have anything else to post about right now, you get to come along for the ride.

The rub is flavorful but not too spicy.
My kid loves it.

## Equipment

- Gas grill with top rack
- Grill tongs
- Meat thermometer
- Small bowl for mixing rub
- Large bowl for seasoning chicken
- Small bowl for BBQ sauce
- Silicone brush for BBQ sauce

## Ingredients

### Meat

- 2 pounds chicken wings, cut up
- Around 1 1/2 pounds chicken legs (about six legs)

### Rub

- 2 tablespoons brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon chili powder
- 1 tablespoon paprika (smoked preferred)
- 1 tablespoon black pepper
- 1 tablespoon salt
- Some quantity of garlic-infused olive oil

### Dressing

- Your favorite BBQ sauce

## Instructions

### Preparation

1. In a small bowl, mix all the components of the rub together until they are evenly distributed throughout the mixture.
2. Place all of the chicken in a large bowl.
3. Drizzle the chicken with garlic-infused olive oil.
4. Sprinkle about 1/3rd of the rub over the chicken.
5. Mix the chicken around in the bowl until the rub is evenly distributed.
6. Repeat drizzling the chicken with oil, dusting it with rub, and mixing it two more times, until you are out of rub

### Cooking

1. Preheat your grill at maximum heat with the lid closed for 10 minutes.
2. Using tongs, arrange your chicken on the top rack of the grill.
3. Close the lid of the grill and cook the chicken for 8 minutes.
4. Open the lid and flip the chicken over.
5. Close the lid and cook the chicken for another 8 minutes.
6. Using the meat thermometer, ensure that your chicken has reached an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit. If it has not, lower the grill's heat to medium-low to avoid charring the skin too much, flip the chicken, and grill it for an additional 3 minutes. Continue flipping and grilling for 3 minutes until the chicken has reached an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit.
7. Lower the grill's heat to the minimum.
8. Using the silicone brush, baste the chicken with BBQ sauce.
9. Close the lid and cook the chicken on minimum heat for 2-3 minutes, in order to set the sauce.
10. Open the lid and flip the chicken over.
11. Using the silicone brush, baste the other side of the chicken with BBQ sauce.
12. Close the lid and cook the chicken on minimum heat for another 2-3 minutes.
13. Remove the chicken from the grill and serve it.
