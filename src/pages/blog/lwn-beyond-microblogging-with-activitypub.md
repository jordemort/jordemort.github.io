Once again, I have a new article at [Linux Weekly News](https://lwn.net/)!

Please enjoy [Beyond microblogging with ActivityPub](https://lwn.net/Articles/918224/), which is a sequel of sorts to [my previous article](https://lwn.net/Articles/916154/).

If you are not an LWN subscriber and want to read it this week, send me an email and I'll send you a free link.
